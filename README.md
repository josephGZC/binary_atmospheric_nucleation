## Overview
[[back to contents](#contents)]

Aerosol formation produces tiny particles that act as starting points for cloud formation. These particles can change how clouds reflect sunlight or trap heat, affecting the weather and contributing to climate change. Before aerosols formation, two earlier processes are nucleation and growth. Before aerosol formation, two earlier processes are nucleation and growth. Nucleation occurs at the molecular scale, where a few molecules cluster together to form tiny initial particles, while growth happens at a larger scale as these particles accumulate more molecules and increase in size. There is keen interest in studying the early stages of aerosol formation, especially in multi-component systems, which often begin as binary mixtures. The behavior of these systems is characterized by the shape, composition, and ordering of molecules within the clusters formed during these initial processes. By characterizing these systems, researchers can develop more accurate equations and models to track aerosol formation from its earliest stages, ultimately improving weather prediction and climate models.

## Objectives
[[back to contents](#contents)]

This study investigates nucleation and growth of three binary mixtures of atmospherically relevant gases: water, nonane, 1-butanol.  Representing hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic molecules, these systems are explored using MD simulations to analyze cluster structures and their evolution over time. By linking molecular properties to emerging cluster configurations, this work advances the understanding of fundamental binary nucleation mechanisms and their relevance to atmospheric aerosol formation.

## Simulation Setup
[[back to contents](#contents)]

Three binary mixtures were analyzed: nonane/1-butanol, water/nonane, water/1-butanol (Fig. [2](#anchor-F2)). A cubic simulation box of 40 nm<sup>3</sup> was constructed for each system. The chosen population size for each system was 10,000 molecules, comprising equal amounts of the contained molecule types. The initial structures were copied and randomly inserted several times in the system until the desired total number of molecules was achieved.

## Simulation Analysis
[[back to contents](#contents)]

Each system begins as a binary mixture in the vapor state. As the temperature increases during the simulation, molecules start clustering together, coresponding to the onset of condensation (Fig. [3](#anchor-F3)). Over time, nearly all molecules eventually combine to form larger clusters.

### A. Shape and Compisition of Clusters

Throughout the simulation, a distribution of clusters of varying sizes emerged, in which larger clusters comprise higher number of molecules. The generated clusters were analyzed based on their sphericity (Fig. [4](#anchor-F4), [S1](#anchor-S1), [S2](#anchor-S2)) and mole fraction (Fig. [5](#anchor-F5), [S3](#anchor-S3), [S4](#anchor-S4)). For each property, the median values and their variability (spread) are visualized using boxplots. To facilitate a more convenient comparison, the clusters are categorized into three size ranges: small (10<sup>1</sup> to 10<sup>2</sup> molecules), intermediate (10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> molecules), and large (10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> molecules). 

For all systems, the sphericity of smaller-sized clusters ranges from 0.2 to 0.9 (Fig. [4](#anchor-F4), [S1](#anchor-S1), [S2](#anchor-S2)) with a median between 0.7 to 0.8. This suggests significant structure variability from a spherical configuration in the initial phase of droplet formation. In the case of larger-sized clusters, the median sphericity ranges from 0.8 to 1 across different systems, reflecting their stability in a spherical shape. These observations corroborate and expand upon the research by [Tarek et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp972278s), which reported increased shape variability in smaller water/ethanol clusters. Although water/nonane clusters are spherical on average, it exhibits a similar microarrangement to the clusters simulated by [Obeidat et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp509919u), where they define a water/nonane droplet to have a lens-on-sphere structure. This model describes the nonane cluster as a lens shape that wets the spherical shape of the water cluster.

</p>

Among systems with minimal or partial miscibility gap (nonane/butanol and water/butanol), nearly equal amounts of each nucleating vapor were observed (median X~0.5) as shown in Fig. [5](#anchor-F5), [S3](#anchor-S3). Furthermore, a trend was observed in which the spread of mole fraction values decreased with increasing cluster size (as indicated by the decreasing area of the boxplots). In contrast, the water/nonane system exhibited a wide spread of mole fraction values in the small clusters, which is likely caused by the pronounced miscibility gap between the involved molecules (Fig. [S4](#anchor-S4)). Interestingly, larger clusters in the water/nonane system displayed mole fraction values close to 0.5. While the observed near-equimolar distribution of nucleating vapors in nonane/butanol and water/butanol clusters is likely due to the low miscibility gap in these systems, the similar behavior in water/nonane may be caused by another interaction, such as the clumping of unary clusters without significant mixing.

### B. Binary Ordering of Molecules in Clusters

To get a better understanding of the cluster shape and composition, a look into the internal ordering within the cluster is necessary. Radial layers are reported for the largest cluster over time, which were accompanied by cluster snapshots (Fig. [6](#anchor-F6)). The lower-value radial layers signify regions closer to the core while the larger-value radial layers are closer to the cluster surface. Snapshots illustrating the radial layers were captured at 1 ns, 10 ns, and 100 ns to provide a visual representation.

For the nonane/1-butanol system, majority of clusters were well mixed as most radial layers had mole fraction values close to 0.5, indicated by the grayish color in Fig. [6](#anchor-F6). This is in agreement with the visual inspection of the nuclei snapshots, where nonane (green spheres) and 1-butanol (yellow spheres) are evenly distributed in the cluster surface (Fig. [7a-c](#anchor-F7)) and the interior of the cluster (Fig. [7d-f](#anchor-F7)), indicating homogeneous mixing between the two nucleating species. Additionally, the observed mixing behavior further verifies that the reluctant co-nucleation reported for nonane and alcohol mixtures is minimized in nonane/1-butanol by the relatively long alkyl tail of 1-butanol. 

Radial analysis of the water/1-butanol system reveals alternating regions of high water and 1-butanol concentration, indicated by the alternating bluish and reddish regions in the heatmap (Fig. [8](#anchor-F8)). The cluster snapshots clarify this observation as it shows that a simple core-shell structure is observed at the initial stages of nucleation, with water (blue spheres) at the core and 1-butanol (yellow spheres) at the surface (Fig. [9](#anchor-F9)). Over time, another layer of butanol and water is configured, resulting in butanol-water-butanol-water layering. At the later stages, another layer of water-butanol is formed again (Fig. [9](#anchor-F9)). 

A water/nonane system was previously explored by [Wagner and Strey (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp011460x). They observed a two-pathway nucleation mechanism, which suggests that both species nucleate independently in a unary manner. This is attributed to the pronounced miscibility gap between the two molecules. It was proposed that, in a system composed of an immiscible pair, it is likely for heterogeneous-like nucleation to occur, whereby the first species to nucleate serves as a substrate for the nucleation of the other. This hypothesis is supported by our observations, with radial analysis showing deep blue and red hue at the heatmap at all time steps (Fig. [S5](#anchor-S5))). Visually, a lens-on-sphere structure was observed, consisting of a large central nonane cluster to which are adsorbed several independent water clusters (Fig. [S6a-c](#anchor-S6)). The cross-section confirms the RDP analysis as no mixing is observed, and each individual structure is either pure nonane or pure water (Fig. [S6d-f](#anchor-S6)).

### C. Unary Ordering of Molecules in Clusters

In investigating the micro-structures within clusters exhibiting minimal or partial miscibility gaps ($nb$, $wm$, $wb$, $bm$), fragments were identified inside the largest clusters. Molecules were considered part of a fragment when clustering criteria were met (Stillinger criterion and energy criterion discussed earlier), with higher fragmentation indicating fewer unary components were networked in the cluster. The fragmentations were likely caused by localized miscibility gaps within the cluster. The results were presented in plots showcasing the total unary components via a line plot and the degree of fragmentation with stacked bar plots, wherein a more reddish bar signifies less fragmentation (a more networked structure) and a bluish bar signifies more fragmentation (a less networked structure). For the butanol component of $wb$, all the molecules were networked to each other as indicated by the red color bars for the largest cluster over time (Fig.~\ref{fig:frag_wb_2}). In contrast, significant fragmentation was observed in the water component of $wb$, as depicted by the varying range of colors from blue to light red Fig.~\ref{fig:frag_wb_1}. A sample 3D representation, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:frag_snapshot}, serves as a visual aid for the fragmentation in $wb$. In the other pairs, it was also observed that one component had a networked ordering (bars had uniform red color) while another component had a degree of fragmentation as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:frag_nb_1}-\ref{fig:frag_bm_2}. This trend was less noticeable in pairs with smaller miscibility gaps like in the case of $nb$, wherein the 1-butanol component showed only a small degree of fragmentation (Fig.~\ref{fig:frag_nb_2}).

## Conclusion
[[back to contents](#contents)]

A broad overview is first extracted from the clusters based on sphericity and mole fraction. In this stage of the analysis, clusters were found to be more spherical with increasing cluster size regardless of miscibility. While more miscible species had less mole fraction variability from an equimolar composition.
Substructural features were also observed in terms of orientational ordering in each cluster. Diverse clustering structures of six binary combinations from the water/$n$-nonane/1-butanol/methanol quaternary pool were revealed using molecular dynamics. To summarize: $nb$ resulted in homogeneously-mixed clusters due to their minimal miscibility gap \cite{viisanen1998measurement}. Similarly, the $wm$ clusters were of homogeneous composition due to the miscibility between the components, with only slight enrichment in methanol at the surface and water in the interior. Meanwhile, $bm$ and $wb$ portrayed more distinct core-shell structures. Beyond mere enrichment, the core and shell regions of $nm$ were of pure composition. Finally, $wn$ assumed a lens-on-sphere configuration composed of a large central $n$-nonane cluster to which several smaller water clusters were adsorbed, without any observed mixing.

From these findings, we observe that (a) highly miscible pairs ($wm$, $nb$) form homogeneously-mixed clusters, (b) partially miscible pairs, depending on the degree of miscibility gap, can form component-enriched regions ($bm$) or even completely segregated layers ($nm$) as a means to maximize favorable interactions \cite{tarek1997molecular,chen2003simulating}, and (c) completely immiscible pairs ($wn$) exhibit heterogeneous-like nucleation, wherein each component nucleates independently, and the first cluster serves as the substrate for the nucleation of the other \cite{wagner2001two}. In partially miscible pairs, network-like microstructures and fragmented pockets can occur within seemingly uniform clusters. Taken together, the findings in this work have a direct impact on nucleation calculations, as we have shown that binary mixtures exhibit microheterogeneity and non-sphericity, and thus do not necessarily obey the assumptions of CNT (spherical droplet and equimolar surface) \cite{vehkamaki2006classical}. Current theory has been shown to make nonphysical predictions \cite{laaksonen2001breakdown}, and the structural information that we have presented in this study should be considered in the development of future models.
