## Overview
[[back to contents](#contents)]

Aerosol formation produces tiny particles that act as starting points for cloud formation. These particles can change how clouds reflect sunlight or trap heat, affecting the weather and contributing to climate change. Before aerosols formation, two earlier processes are nucleation and growth. Before aerosol formation, two earlier processes are nucleation and growth. Nucleation occurs at the molecular scale, where a few molecules cluster together to form tiny initial particles, while growth happens at a larger scale as these particles accumulate more molecules and increase in size. There is keen interest in studying the early stages of aerosol formation, especially in multi-component systems, which often begin as binary mixtures. The behavior of these systems is characterized by the shape, composition, and ordering of molecules within the clusters formed during these initial processes. By characterizing these systems, researchers can develop more accurate equations and models to track aerosol formation from its earliest stages, ultimately improving weather prediction and climate models.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Where do the investigations start? </br>
> * The shape, structure, and arrangement of clusters depend on the properties of the molecules that make them up, particularly how strongly the molecules attract to each other. </br>
> * By studying hydrophilic (water-loving), hydrophobic (water-repelling), and amphiphilic (having both water-loving and water-repelling parts) molecules, we can predict how clusters will behave based on these properties.

## Objectives
[[back to contents](#contents)]

This study investigates nucleation and growth of six binary mixtures of atmospherically relevant gases: water, $n$-nonane, 1-butanol.  Representing hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic molecules, these systems are explored using MD simulations to analyze cluster structures and their evolution over time. By linking molecular properties to emerging cluster configurations, this work advances the understanding of fundamental binary nucleation mechanisms and their relevance to atmospheric aerosol formation.

Carbon (C), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) atoms are labeled. Some hydrogen atoms are grayed out to emphasize the carbon atoms, which are more relevant to the discussion of hydrophobic properties.

## Simulation Setup
[[back to contents](#contents)]

Six systems were prepared: nonane/1-butanol, water/1-butanol, and water/nonane. A cubic simulation box of 40 nm$^3$ was constructed for each system. The chosen population size for each system was 10,000 molecules, comprising equal amounts of the contained molecule types. The initial structures were copied and randomly inserted several times in the system until the desired total number of molecules was achieved.
